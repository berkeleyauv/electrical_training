Hello there! Welcome to UR@B electrical team! Here's a little project that will get you started on the whole electrical design process from start to finish. We provide a reference solution that serves as both a design document and engineering guide. Feel free to do as much or as little as you want but do get through the whole thing. If at any point you feel stuck or want to learn more, don't hesitate to ask questions. Good luck!

## Project Statement

- Build a device that mimics the "Level" feature in the iOS Measuring app

When you receive a project from say a manager or customer, it usually comes as a vague idea about what it should accomplish. As an engineer, part of your job is to ask the right questions and come up with a solid set of specifications and vision for something you can make. There are a myriad of questions you could possibly ask and learning what to ask can itself be a whole topic of discussion. Often times they involve things like manufacturability, timeline, cost, size, parts availability, operating environment, regulations, number of units, etc. Sometimes you may even ask why the product is even necessary in the first place. Is there a more fundamental problem that needs solving?

This project is meant to be a fun exploration in problem solving so we're not going to impose strict requirements on your solution. Fleshing out the project statement a bit, your solution only needs to meet the following.

- Measure an angle with respect to the ground
- Allow for setting a target angle
- Indicate when the measured angle is within 1Â° of the target angle

With those requirements, let's take a look at the [reference solution](reference_solution.md). Of course, you are welcome (and encouraged) to make your own.
