Hello there! Welcome to UR@B electrical team! Here's a little project that will get you started on the whole electrical design process from start to finish. We provide a reference solution that serves as both a design document and engineering guide. Feel free to do as much or as little as you want but do get through the whole thing. If at any point you feel stuck or want to learn more, don't hesitate to ask questions. Good luck!

It is important to note that PCB design and firmware (the main focus of this training) is just one part of electrical. There is also a significant amount of "integration" which involves getting the various components we buy or design working with each other both electrically and mechanically.

# Training
UR@B Training will introduce you to the **RP2040** microcontroller which is part of the Raspberry Pi brand. 

At the end of the training, you will know: 

1. Basic Circuit Concepts
1. Basic Firmware
2. Basic Printed Circuit Board Design (PCB) CAD Tools 

### High Level View:

## Electronics (Hardware)

## Firmware (Software)

## PCB CAD Tools
